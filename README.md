# Hi there! 👋

I'm Zakaria Elfakhar, a passionate developer currently honing my skills in programming and software development. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

- 🌱 **Currently Learning:** I’m currently learning **Data Structures Level 2** from *Programming Advices School* and taking a **Course on Algorithms** to practice advanced concepts in C#. I am also building projects to apply the new things I learn, solidifying my understanding from the past 2.7 years.
-  One of my favorite sites is [ProgrammingAdvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com), where I find invaluable tips and tutorials that help me grow as a developer.

- 💻 **Skills:** C#, .NET, ADO.NET, T-SQL, WinForms, SQL Server, OOP, Data Structures, SQL Server Management Studio.

## Projects

- **Bank Management System (Current Project):** A full-fledged banking system to handle transactions, transfers, and client management, using WinForms, ADO.NET, T-SQL, and SQL Server. It practices real-world banking features like handling transactions with `UPDLOCK` and other concurrency control mechanisms.

- **Gym Management System:** A desktop application I created for managing gym memberships, schedules, and payments. It's a .NET desktop app structured with three-tier architecture, integrated with a SQL Server database.

- **Book Management System:** An older project I created to manage book inventories. It's a simple application built in C# using ADO.NET and SQL Server.

- **Driving & Vehicle License Department (DVLD) System:** My first full .NET desktop application, structured with three-tier architecture. It integrates with SQL Server and handles various functionalities for issuing and managing driving licenses.

## Goals

- 🚀 To continue gaining experience by building various projects.
- 🔧 To improve my understanding of **Algorithms** and **Data Structures** and apply them to real-world problems in C#.
- 💼 To evolve into a **Software Architect**, managing large-scale software projects and databases.
- 🌐 To apply best practices like concurrency control (e.g., `UPDLOCK`) in database-heavy applications.
