Hi there! 👋
I'm Zakaria Elfakhar, a passionate developer continuously honing my skills in programming and software development. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

About Me
🌱 Currently Learning: I'm focused on Data Structures Level 2 at Programming Advices School, and also taking a course in Algorithms to practice advanced concepts in C# Data Structures.

I'm building a new project to apply and reinforce everything I've learned over the past 2.7 years, incorporating new techniques and concepts as I progress.
🌐 One of my favorite sites is ProgrammingAdvices.com, where I find invaluable tips and tutorials that help me grow as a developer.

💻 Skills: C#, .NET, ADO.NET, T-SQL, WinForms, SQL Server, OOP, Data Structures, SQL Server Management Studio, async/await programming, C++.

🏋️ Projects: I’m currently working on a bank management project, building a full-scale desktop banking application using the three-tier architecture pattern.

Projects
Bank Management System (Current Project in C#): I'm currently developing a desktop banking application that includes managing client accounts, transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers), and tracking balances.

This project focuses on multi-tiered architecture, integrating Microsoft SQL Server for data storage.
I’m utilizing async/await to enhance responsiveness and improve performance, especially for handling transactions and large-scale data operations.
This project is my current priority as it helps me apply more advanced concepts, such as concurrency control and business logic for financial systems.
Bank Management System (C++ Console App): I previously built a bank project using C++ to practice object-oriented programming concepts.

The system includes basic banking functionalities like creating accounts, managing balances, and processing simple transactions (deposits and withdrawals).
This was a foundational step before moving into my current bank project in C#.
Book Management System: A desktop application designed for managing books in a library or personal collection.

This project involves basic CRUD operations, allowing users to add, update, delete, and search for books.
It’s a good example of structuring small-scale projects using three-tier architecture.
Gym Management System (Completed): This was a desktop application I created for managing gym memberships, schedules, and payments.

Structured with a three-tier architecture and integrated with a Microsoft SQL Server database.
This project allowed me to practice with ADO.NET and T-SQL stored procedures, and implement basic CRUD functionality for gym operations.
Driving & Vehicle License Department (DVLD) System (Completed): My first full .NET desktop application, structured with a three-tier architecture, for managing driving license services.

This project includes applying for first-time licenses, renewals, replacements, and more.
Goals
🚀 To gain more experience with larger, more complex applications, particularly in the financial domain.
🔧 To improve my Git and GitHub skills by managing branches, resolving conflicts, and collaborating on projects.
🏗️ To work towards becoming a software architect, managing large projects and databases, and building efficient systems with optimized performance.
🧠 To build strong problem-solving skills through different projects and coding challenges.
